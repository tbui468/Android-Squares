//get a complete vertical slice with two puzzle cubes

    //sets - problem with screen flicking black when transitioning from surfaceview to login view
        //one possible solution is to use TextureView
        //difference is that Texture view does not create a new window, and is instead treated as a regular view

    //make transition from login page to game page more natural (transition buttons off-screen and then transitioning sets on-screen, for example)
    //recall that we can create View animations using the animation library provided in android standard library (recall the tutorial with rotating stars, etc)
    //add this basic structure in before the codebase gets too large and complex
        //start views offscreen and animate them in

    //clear a puzzle automatically transitions back to puzzle select screen after animation is done playing (after clearPulse()) function
        //need to clean up the function queue system (currently using a ton of flags to determine which function to queue/call)
        //need to make it generalized (either queue functions with parameters together, or queue functions and parameters separately and combine at call time)
        //this should also be combined with the undo queue system.
        //all commands go through this queue - no more separate systems

    //seems to be a problem with setting permission and logging in (it's doing it twice)
        //push facebook login button passes the baton to CallbackManager which has user login with name/avatar permission
        // then comes back and executes my code in setButtonListener (which adds email permission)
        //this causes facebook to go back to login page with name/avatar/email permission
            //might need to see the other option for loggin in on the documentation and not rely on CallbackManager

    //build a quick and dirty implementation of the steps below:
        //get fb_user_id and access_token on android (both strings)
            //I have the access_token - how to get fb_user_name?
        //send http request to webserver to authenticate user (by issuing Graph API request using fb_user_name and access_token sent to from android device)
            //let's use Nodejs, express and TypeScript to set up web server - no need for html/css since we only need to send http requests with two parameters
            //web server has two forms - fb_user_id, and access_token.  use curl to send http request to Graph API with this
        //if fb_user_id and access_token verified, 'log in' to the server database using fb_user_name (and now can alter database entries for this user)
        //when user solves a puzzle/saves data, write data (such as transformations taken to solve puzzles) to database

    //have bubbles of friends who cleared the current puzzle appear by the transformation box they completed it in
        //have a ring (or other indicator) showing completion, and the same ring appears on user bubble after clearing a puzzle
        //if more than two friends, have a bubble showing a "+12" (number of other friends).  Pushing this bubble shows a list of other friends that user can look at
            //clicking on friend bubble shows the first move transformation that player did as a hint

    //complete puzzle set 6: similar to set 3, make a few variations of puzzles - can mix them up later
    //make puzzles that can be finished in 2 transformations, but can also allow up to 3 max transformations
    //make puzzles where user has to connect 3 dark blocks (don't have too many of those yet) (including 2+ colors)
    //3 adjacent above and two adjacent below (or 1)


    //instead of a tutorial system, allow players to see first move of friend's solution
    //put in first touch of my solutions for tutorial puzzles
    //could create an animation object that just animates, fades out, and dies
    //so I could just create a bunch and not worry about destroying them

    //reorder puzzles into more interesting format (instead of the rows and columns they are in now)
        //this will also allow user to choose the next puzzle, giving them more agency and choice

    //Back button is normal to have in the app - keep it there since it's better to have an in-app way to go back (but include android back button functionality too)

    //bug - a 4x4 doesn't split apart to 1x1s when puzzle is cleared (it splits only to 1x1s)
        //also refactor puzzle clear code - it's very messy

    //make all the puzzles solvable within 2, 3 or 4 moves.  But give player 1, 2, or 3 extra moves.  Don't tell players how many moves puzzles can be completed in
        //then connect to social media and show a pictures of friends who completed it and the number of moves it took them
            //if playing offline, show the lowest possible number of moves

            //how about instead of solution, show friend's touch inputs?? This would be a fun hint (just save transformations/merge/split instead of saving actual raw inputs)
        //puzzles floating in the background also have friend's profile pics attached
        //tap on friend's profile to request hint???
        //sign into facebook to allow users to see friend's scores
        //can use 'python anywhere' to save data for now (or find some free/easy deployment with nodejs)
            //user facebook name: set, puzzle, number of transformations to solve
            //save all to database on pythonanywhere website - for users to access

    //when clearing a puzzle, should automatically transition out of current puzzle
        //just transitioning out and highlighting the completed puzzle and highlighting the newly unlocked ones

    //animation for clearing puzzles (queue both these commands)
            //need to pulse colored fractals....
            //all colored fractals pulse white

    //tutorial for swap, pinch in, pinch out, rotate, reflect
        //have a dot animate showing finger motion to perform certain action

    //puzzle goal should be obvious when looking at a puzzle for the first time
        //user should know exactly where the colored squares need to go to connect all the colors
        //having a clear end goal will make the puzzle for interesting, and encourage users to start thinking about solutions

    //problem - there isn't enough integration with current puzzles -
        //it feels like a cluster of random colors (it should feel like I'm connection colors together into lines/trees
        //could add more darks colors
        //keep in mind that all the colors needs to connect on the surface of the cube

    //allows swapping with difference sizes, with the condition being that IF the swapped fractal were the correct size the swap would be valid

    //idea: have a shader that changes color theme inside each complete cube
        //need this carrot for people who like visual flair
    //idea from Ollie: show friend who completed puzzle the fastest (either set or individual puzzles??)
        //or maybe show the number of transformations your friend took to finish it
        //or show your friend's solution
        //or request solution from a facebook friend, or send solution to a facebook friend

        //or each puzzle set you complete gives you "points" to request help
        //you can use these points directly or give them to facebook friends who need help with a puzzle

    //holding finger down highlights what part of the cube you are touch (center, edge or corner) so that user learns where to touch to transform

    //puzzles - get 2 sets done (combine first two current sets together into one set.  Finish reflection/rotation for second set)
    //first set be 1x1s (of up to two colors)
    //second set introduce reflections/rotations
    //third set introduce translations (and a third color)
    //fourth set up the number of transformations to 4 + introduce 4th color (also lengthen color connections to 3 to 4 colored blocks)
    //fifth set introduce 4x4 fractals - up the length of chains
    //sixth set - up the length of chains
    //seventh - up the length of chains
    //eighth - up the length of chains
