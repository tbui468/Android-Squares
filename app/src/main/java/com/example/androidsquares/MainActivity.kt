//get a complete vertical slice with two puzzle cubes (will make it easy to expand to 8 cubes later to form the tesseract)

    //puzzle clearing conditions (connecting all colors will trigger a clear condition)
        //need non-moveable fractals (either within the 4x4 grid or hanging off the sides)

        //IDEA: create the first 8 puzzles - for now stick to having ALL fractals inside the 4x4 grid, but stationary colored one

    //currently square index is hacked in (using lateinit)
            //will need to add index to Square constructor so that different cube nets can be used (check notebook for the 8 nets chosen)

    //do the same thing with cubes??????
        //will require transformation of cubes - how will I do this if the cubes are rotating???

    //load default data from Data.kt
    //save data to preferences (since this is so much easier than using a database)
        //save puzzle data as single string per puzzle.  Can parse on load to get fractal types

    //order of drawing is out of order since call objects are at 0f in the z-axis
    //one option is to move active cube/square closer to camera (move in the positive z direction) so that there isn't any z fighting/undefined depth problems

    //add more flexibility to cube unfolding to allow 8 different unfolded patterns - look at notes in notebook

    //if any puzzle dimensions are odd in either axis, then when zooming in on fractals (and splitting them), center it
        //better yet, just have the camera zoom in on the correct location such that the odd dimension(s) are centered

    //draw lines between four outer corners of Square so that user has visual queue about where to touch/drag

    //allows swapping with difference sizes, with the condition being that IF the swapped fractal were the correct size the swap would be valid

    //have all empty fractals crashes everything bc my removal of vertices belonging to empty fractals was messy

    //idea: have a shader that changes color theme inside each complete cube

    //holding finger down highlights what part of the cube you are touch (center, edge or corner) so that user learns where to touch to transform
