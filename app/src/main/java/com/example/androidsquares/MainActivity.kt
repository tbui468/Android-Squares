//get a complete vertical slice with two puzzle cubes (will make it easy to expand to 8 cubes later to form the tesseract)

    //make puzzles contain be playable in a 4x6 grid

    //make a new Set class that can be clicked to zoom
        //on click
            //set fades out and is destroyed on animation end
            //create squares, and fade in
            //camera zooms in

    //on click square
        //square fades out, and is destroyed on animation end
        //create fractals, and fade in

    //make everything 2d again - make the 'cube' a puzzleset to select
        //selecting apuzzleset zooms in to display a grid of up to 24 puzzles (recall that we can fit 6x4 squares on the screen)
        //one bronze level, two silver levels, 3 gold levels, 3 platinum levels

    //puzzle goal should be obvious when looking at a puzzle for the first time
        //user should know exactly where the colored squares need to go to connect all the colors
        //having a clear end goal will make the puzzle for interesting, and encourage users to start thinking about solutions

    //reset camera back to normal position looking down z axis
        //get the puzzles fun first before worring fancy 3d cameras
        //design 1 cube puzzle (both fractal and square puzzles)
        //make egdes of square visible for easier selection/transformation

    //get cubes in correct location on screen (Dali cross formation)
    //save camera positions for easy/quick changing
        //give all cubes the same orientation when opening (including the squares/fractals)
        //when opening a cube/square, move to camera towards the center point, but keep the camera orienation the same
            //from camera's perspective, just shift left/right/up/down
            //this will simplify everything since everything is facing the same direction

            //IMPLEMENTATION: calculate camera orientation default (when camera is first created)
                //start camera orientation and open cube/square orientation are set once and never changed
                //calculate point that is x distance from center of cube/square, that also satisfies camera orientation requirement (equal to default orientation)
                    //need to save look-at variable to camera class and update per step while animating this
                //look at will just be set to center pos of cube/square

    //problem - there isn't enough integration with current puzzles -
        //it feels like a cluster of random colors (it should feel like I'm connection colors together into lines/trees
        //could add more darks colors
        //keep in mind that all the colors needs to connect on the surface of the cube

    //puzzle clearing conditions (connecting all colors will trigger a clear condition)
        //need non-moveable fractals (either within the 4x4 grid or hanging off the sides)

        //IDEA: create the first 8 puzzles - for now stick to having ALL fractals inside the 4x4 grid, but stationary colored one

    //currently square index is hacked in (using lateinit)
            //will need to add index to Square constructor so that different cube nets can be used (check notebook for the 8 nets chosen)

    //do the same thing with cubes??????
        //will require transformation of cubes - how will I do this if the cubes are rotating???

    //load default data from Data.kt
    //save data to preferences (since this is so much easier than using a database)
        //save puzzle data as single string per puzzle.  Can parse on load to get fractal types

    //order of drawing is out of order since call objects are at 0f in the z-axis
    //one option is to move active cube/square closer to camera (move in the positive z direction) so that there isn't any z fighting/undefined depth problems

    //add more flexibility to cube unfolding to allow 8 different unfolded patterns - look at notes in notebook

    //if any puzzle dimensions are odd in either axis, then when zooming in on fractals (and splitting them), center it
        //better yet, just have the camera zoom in on the correct location such that the odd dimension(s) are centered

    //draw lines between four outer corners of Square so that user has visual queue about where to touch/drag

    //allows swapping with difference sizes, with the condition being that IF the swapped fractal were the correct size the swap would be valid

    //have all empty fractals crashes everything bc my removal of vertices belonging to empty fractals was messy

    //idea: have a shader that changes color theme inside each complete cube

    //holding finger down highlights what part of the cube you are touch (center, edge or corner) so that user learns where to touch to transform
