    //write 4 puzzles for set 5
    //3 or 4  or 5 transformations (can reorder them later)
    //up to three colors - try to have puzzles that take advantage of 5x6 grid
    //add puzzles with 4 and 5 transformations too (later)
    //once all 8 extra sets are complete, reorganize and cut the similar ones and reorder the ones kept

    //background music - placeholder is fine (set up resource files that can be loaded in on app start)
    //use MediaPlayer
    //sound effects - placeholders are fine (set up resource files that can be loaded in on app start)
    //use SoundPool builder??? Apparently there are people who have problems with this
    //look around for more options before settling on a sound API for sound effects

    //tutorial (show taps and drags)

    //create main logo (how can it keep with the same simple theme of the rest of the game)
    //add glow effects to simulate how final design should look
    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    //////////////////////////////////////////USER EXPERIENCE////////////////////////////////////////////
    //when a puzzle is cleared for the first time, and after the pulse animations, create an animated white spark in the blocks
        //this white spark should always be there to signify to use that this puzzle is already cleared (instead of having to remember if Square was yellow while inside puzzle)
    //add shaders that change theme as a prize at the end of each (or near the end) of each set

    //high chance that independent animation that can be fired off and forgotten will be needed (for non-essential/non-sequential animations)
        //find a way to implement this without breaking too much stuff

    //each fractal pules in turn, but it would look smoother if the animations overlapped instead of being play one after another

    //add a small amount of camera sway to make it more visually interesting (or at least animating background)

    //add Geometry Wars style glow shaders

    //add a little wigglyness to the squares when moving (squishing and stretching based on how user interacts with it)

    //how should squares and fractals animate on/offscreen?
        //idea: have them spawn overlapped with parent object (sets for squares, and squares for fractals)
        //and then they animate to final positions

    //also, need a way to differentiate between sets, puzzles, and fractals

    //when user clicks on fractal, create a semi transparent circle expand from that point (like how android framework does it)
        //this is to provide feedback and also keep visual style consistent
        //also provides visual feedback when waiting for a double tap (rather than just showing no animation)
