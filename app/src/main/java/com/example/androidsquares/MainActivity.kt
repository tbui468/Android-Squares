//get a complete vertical slice with two puzzle cubes (will make it easy to expand to 8 cubes later to form the tesseract)

    //up texture size/change anti-aliasing so that there are no jaggies (and maybe add a thin border or put a small space between fractals)

    //get a cube up and animating (rotating on screen)

    //implement a function to swap texture coords in a given fractal, square, or cube (this also helps test to see if cube really is animating correctly)

    //animations of cubes, squares and fractals for transition between screens

    //each element type can be associated with an array of texture coordinates
    //get Fractals, Faces, Cubes displayed and user able to transition between the three stages.  Get 8 cubes forming into Dali Cross/tesseract

    //3 transformations with forming and splitting (all the coordinate values can be hard coded - only about 25 with a 4x4 with fractal sizes 1, 2 4)
    //all animations transitioning from 3d cube to unwrapped 6 square faces, to splitting to (up to) 16 fractals
    //GUI: go back button (going down into the fractal involves tapping a square face???)
        //could i use pinch in / pinch out to zoom in and out on fractals????
